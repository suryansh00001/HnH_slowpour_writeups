I have found some other flag which wasn't expected by them ...
the very vague flag was just on first page or home page just have to scroll down

now come to my flag which I found 
as this was osint challenge so I thought that I have to search for there original website as mentioned in the challenge
here I found this page 
https://hackersnhops.com/voices/

here I found 2 parts of the flag in style and html of the page 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3be0caf6-8b0b-4d01-9572-ecb53a1fe514)

and the 3rd part was on the page itself 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27bbb64b-661c-446c-8ecd-295664a134f5)

acc to me the flag was HnH{Th3v01cesAr3Ev3ryWh3r3}
but it was shown incorrect...

kinda loophole in the challenge
